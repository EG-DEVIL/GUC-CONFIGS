0;** We have reached the ranch at the edge of the peninsula. **;
0;** Our reports show that some sort of facility is hidden within it... **;
0;** MISSION: FIND A WAY IN! NEUTRALIZE ANY OPPOSING FORCE! **;
20;** Wait until we meet up! Hold the zombies off! **;
0;** MOVE! **;
0;** This little tram seems to go well with the factory: it has chickens. **;
0;** Why would they even trap 4 chickens on a tram that doesn't seem to move...? **;
0;** ... **;
0;** WAIT! THE CHICKENS ARE THE POWER! SHOOT THEM! **;
0;** FIND A WAY INTO THE COMPOUND! ACTIVATE THE LIFT! **;

0;** MOVE! WE GOTTA GET THROUGH! **;
20;** We are close to the central warehouse... **;
0;** HOLD! WE NEED TO RESIST WHILE THE DOOR OPENS! **;
0;** We're in one of the main warehouses... **;
0;** The rocket fuel seems to be cooled in those sketchy tanks - but what is it? **;
0;** Enabling the ignition process... Rocket launch started... **;
0;** Something's wrong! There seems to be an fuel overload! **;
0;** THE FUEL CONTAINER IS OPENING! **;
0;** Quick! Trim the excess of nuclear chickens! **;
0;** We have interrupted the explosion for now... **;
0;** The radiactive chicken remains are toxic! The air is getting contaminated! **;
15;** QUICK! GET INTO THE SAFE ROOM! **;
0;** We should not be affected by the toxins here... **;
0;** THE TOXINS ARE GETTING IN THE VENTILATION SYSTEM! WE'RE DOOMED! **;
0;** We need to find a way out! The rocket is going to blow up! **;
0;** According to our data we must be close to one of the energy plants... **;
20;** Hold the line! The doors will open soon and we will get to one of the underground power plants! **;
0;** KEEP IT UP! THE SECURITY DOORS ARE CRACKED NOW! **;
0;** GO! GO! GO! We should be close to an exit of some sort! **;
0;** MOVE! The facility is blowing up and this area is likely to colapse! **;
0;** This is enormous... **;
0;** The power plant is at the other side - we need to get there! Be careful not to fall! **;
15;** The door seems locked... **;
0;** RESIST UNTIL WE CAN GET THROUGH! HOLD IT! **;
0;** GET GOING! IT'S GETTING WORSE! **;
0;** GO! GET INSIDE AND USE THE LIFT! THIS IS ABOUT TO BLOW! **;
22;** HOLD! THE ELEVATOR'S ENGINES ARE WARMING UP! **;
0;** KEEP IT UP! RESIST! **;
0;** ONE LAST BIT! HOLD IT! **;
0;** CONGRATULATIONS TEAM - WE DID IT! **;
0;** We are in the depths of the facility... **;
0;** The airstrike team will be blowing up the command center soon! **;
0;** MISSION: FIND A WAY OUT! NEUTRALIZE ANY OPPOSING FORCE! **;
20;** GET TOGETHER! We're close to the outdoor areas! **;
0;** MOVE! WE GOTTA REACH THE EXTRACTION POINT AT THE HELIPAD! **;
20;** The direct pathway towards the underground exit is locked... **;
0;** HOLD! We will try to find a way from the facility's top instead! **;
0;** GET READY! The door is about to open! **;
0;** Look! The control tower has been blown up! **;
0;** We can now hijack one of the helicopters and leave! **;
0;** SECURITY SYSTEM BREACHED! THE PATH WILL SHOW SOON! **;
20;** RESIST! THE ELEVATOR DOOR WILL BE OPENING SOON! **;
15;** GET INSIDE! THE ELEVATOR IS LEAVING SOON! **;
