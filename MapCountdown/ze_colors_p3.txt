0;** Believe it or not this map was once a tutorial and twice a duck! **;
0;** Level: Lemon **;
0;** This level looks like good old Louisiana: lines and squares all along the little lonely land **;
0;** GET GOING! Tension has been built in the spawn area! **;
25;** RESIST! We're pathetically close to the spawn still! **;
0;** One tiny bit more! We're almost there! **;
30;** Hold right here! There are 4 entrances - take care of them! **;
10;** Keep it up! 10 seconds left! **;
30;** RESIST! We need to wait for a bit until we fly-fly-fly! **;
0;** Hold it a bit more! The magical energy is energy-ny-zing! **;
0;** Last few seconds! HOLD IT! **;
25;** Split hold! Both sides must survive! RESIST! **;
10;** Hold it! Last 10 seconds! **;
0;** Do you see it? Time to practice ropeless bungee jumping! **;
15;** Narrow hold! Narrower time! RESIST A LITTLE OR DIE! **;
0;** Get moving! We lost time! MAP IS LONG ENOUGH NOW TO BE DECENT! **;
30;** One more hold and then the woody poody finale! **;
0;** I'm quite sure you're wishing you had done something with your life now... **;
25;** THIS IS OUR LAST STAND! RESIST! **;
0;** GO! The absurdly stupid ending awaits with more absurd holding than ever! **;
0;** THE BRIDGE WILL GO SOON! KEEP IT UP!!! **;
30;** GET READY! THE LAST WAVE IS INCOMING! **;
0;** HOLD IT! WE MUST SURVIVE FOR THE LAST BIT! **;
