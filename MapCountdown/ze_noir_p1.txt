0;** SCENE 1: Depths of Erebus **;
0;** ... **;
0;** We have managed to sneak into the abandoned basements and sewers of South Metropoli **;
10;** From here we should be able to reach either the proletariat trenches or the financial district. **;
23;** The distant sound from the underground trains can be heard... **;
0;** RESIST! We need to cross one of the abandoned train lines to reach the power plants... **;
30;** HOLD! This path leads to a few industrial warehouses and the generators! **;
0;** Keep it up! I can hear the door's engine moving through the wall! **;
0;** KEEP IT UP! The door's about to open! **;
0;** GO! The door's moving! **;
20;** We're going to have to split up here! We'll meet up soon - hopefully! **;
20;** HOLD! These doors will take a bit to unlock! **;
5;** Keep it up! 5 seconds left! RESIST! **;
0;** We're trapped in here unless we unlock the pneumatic gates! **;
0;** Resist until we find a way out! **;
15;** We got it! Keep holding! The door will open soon **;
0;** We've been exposed for too long to the chemicals in the air... **;
0;** The violent reaction is starting now - we will be no more but dust lost in memory. **;
20;** The lift will leave in 20 seconds... HOLD! **;
0;** WE'RE LEAVING! HOP IN! **;
15;** RESIST! The sounds of the city can be heard through this door! We're close! **;
0;** Keep it up! One last bit! **;
0;** We need to unlock the doors to get under the highway and advance further... **;
20;** Security overwritten! The door will open soon! **;
0;** Keep holding! It's about to open! RESIST! **;
0;** This is the entrance to the proletariat trench #57... **;
0;** We need to wait until the door opens... **;
32;** Hold the area! We can't let anything through! **;
0;** Keep it up! There's a bit still to go! **;
0;** MOVE! THE DOOR IS OPENING NOW! **;
40;** This is one of the multiple entrances to the trench... **;
0;** The doors are sealed to prevent the toxic atmosphere from polluting the trenches further. **;
0;** RESIST! It will take a while until these doors unlock! **;
0;** The outer doors are opening! Get close! It shouldn't take much longer! **;
0;** GET IN! THE WAY IS OPEN FOR US TO ACCESS THE PROLETARIAT TRENCH!  **;
35;** RESIST! We can't let them enter the trench! It'd be a massacre! **;
0;** The outer doors are about to seal! Keep it up! **;
0;** The inner doors are sealing now! Don't let anything through! **;
0;** HOLD! We will reach one of the lower-financial workers parking lots by this door! **;
0;** We shouldn't let them pass at all! **;
0;** One last bit! Rush towards the basement and sewers! We need to reach the sealed cargo bay! **;
0;** This is an abandoned link from the sewer system to the loading bay! **;
0;** It was used to connect with the proletariat trenches but is rarely used nowadays... **;
0;** RESIST ONE LAST BIT! We're close to our destination! **;
0;** We'll open the door in a bit! HOLD! **;
0;** Let's hope that the cargo lift is still functional - it was scarcely used. **;
0;** THERE IT IS! RESIST! **;
0;** GET ON! THE CARGO LIFT IS ABOUT TO GO! **;
