0;** We're stranded in Nowhere... **;
0;** Wait until something happens! **;
0;** What journey will this binary+1 entscheidungsproblem lead us to..? **;
25;** Behind this door may await the Beast of All Cunning Hallways... **;
0;** Cunning Hallways shall be -of course- those that contain Barely Anything -or was it everything-. **;
25;** Wait here! A wise word might come from HIGH **;
0;** Some time has passed and yet no words came... May HIGH have lied? **;
0;** ... **;
0;** It opened but... no word was read or heard... Or was it that we couldn't understand? **;
0;** On this little pool of doubt we must stand for long enough to understand... **;
20;** RESIST! Think and the paradox will come at last! **;
25;** The columnvator is warming up - going up to the puffy clouds requires lots of energy! **;
0;** RESIST! Time is long as to make this little time step nothing - if at all... **;
0;** It stopped for some reason! **;
0;** Perhaps this conveniently placed valve will unlock the reason why? **;
0;** We've opened the valve and the reason has been revealed... **;
0;** It just says 'to have a reason for the valve to be - aesthetics aside'... **;
30;** The entrance to the port of all paradoxes will open soon... **;
0;** Although small all paradoxes fit in -a paradox told me- because they're quite slim... **;
0;** Well done! Now we can get out of this mess of a place and start being by our own beingness! **;
0;** RESIST! The flying floaty matter will take a bit of time to get us out... **;
0;** THE RIDE NEVER ENDS! **;
