30;** WE CAN'T SEEM TO PROGRESS AHEAD... **;
0;** HOLD UNTIL WE FIGURE SOMETHING OUT! **;
0;** THE WINDOW! GET ON IT! **;
0;** We need to make the door move! **;
0;** It looks as if it would probably open if we get the wheel moving... **;
0;** GET GOING! WE HAVE ENOUGH KINETIC ENERGY! **;
0;** THE TOP DOOR IS OPENING 5 SECONDS! **;
60;** The seance is beginning and the spirits are calling... **;
0;** The spirits marked the 'H' leter... **;
0;** 'A'... **;
0;** 'L'... **;
0;** 'L' again... **;
0;** 'O'... **;
0;** 'W'... **;
0;** 'E'... **;
0;** 'E' yet again... **;
0;** 'N'... **;
0;** It spelled 'HALLOWEEN'! **;
0;** Who would have guessed? **;
0;** Something is happening! **;
0;** Get on the lamp! Quick! The spell might not last long! **;
0;** There is some screaking sound in the distance - maybe something is lurking in the darkness! **;
0;** Try to get that old toy going! We must get out of here! **;
0;** MS. WHISKERS HAS WHISKED US! IT'S ALL OVER! **;
0;** OOOAAAAAAAAAAAAH! The darn thing almost squashed us! **;
0;** Being up here the reasonable way to solve the situation would be to go for a swim... If you know what I mean! **;
0;** We're getting close! If we can get into the pumpkin besides the oven we will be safe! **;
0;** We should inspect that giant pumpkin sitting on the stool! **;
0;** THAT'S IT! WE'RE GONNA BLOW IT UP! **;
22;** HOLD AND STAY AFFAR UNTIL THE C4 CHARGE GOES OFF! **;
0;** MOVE! THE DARN THING IS OUT OF THE WAY! **;
0;** We can't get past here with that stove turned on! **;
0;** What can we do? **;
0;** The gas counter! If we mess it up the gas might stop flowing - perhaps? **;
12;** WELL DONE! THE GAS SHOULD STOP RUNNING ANY TIME SOON! **;
0;** The metal is still hot - KEEP RESISTING! **;
0;** NOW! GET MOVING! **;
65;** This seems to be a dead end! HOLD UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENS! **;
0;** Nothing yet... KEEP IT UP! **;
0;** We need to resist... Something must open! **;
0;** Will we be here forever? Have the mapmakers left us at our stake?! That can't be! **;
0;** It looks like this Halloween will be the end... of it all... **;
0;** Hey look! It's Billy the friendly ghost! **;
0;** The tell tale is told to tell that Billy turns spooky things stale! Zombies will become vulnerable! **;
0;** And thus Billy the friendly ghost removed all spooky things from the world **;
0;** and conveniently led our diminute human friends to the end of their little story! **;
0;** THE END **;
0;** There seems to be a nasty bug infestation! **;
0;** Luckily bugs tend to dislike bright lights! **;
0;** Something spooky seems to be going on that table! **;
0;** We need to reach the top! **;
10;** DOOR OPEN IN 10 SECOND **;
