0;** Thanks for your visit. **;
0;** The show is starting soon: broadcasting LIVE in 10. **;
0;** Something's up, something's left. The movement comes soon again. **;
30;** The spectacle must continue, though at a different place. **;
0;** Extras must be part of the action too, or were they the protagonists? **;
0;** A scene change might go well with the changing times that soon may come. **;
0;** Off they go! The calmer tones of the prairie might soothen the wilder souls. **;
0;** First base reached. It ought to begin. **;
0;** Second base reached. Steps further from either end.**;
0;** Third base reached. The double entendre is cuadruple intended. **;
0;** Fourth base reached. Nearing and yet still so afar. **;
15;** Fifth base reached. Wisely interpreted, the still-standing walls will fall. **;
16;** At some point in the journey, the traveller is given a hand. **;
0;** Reaching out for help is at times harder than everything else... **;
0;** Stay in the grey lest you want the tentacles to grab you and take you to your end. **;
20;** [...] The hand that feeds you, that knows you, that helps you -- that hand you will bite. **;
0;** Moving forward and destroying for change... mumbling 'progress'... an ideal... **;
0;** ...the time might come for the trees to hang onto themselves and the wind a hundred tales will tell... **;
0;** And as time is but a rambling story, rambling further it shall flow. **;
0;** Where is the spectacle but in what is unknown? **;
10;** Who was Merle Haggard? Why did his mother cry? **;
0;** The stories of old ought to be forgotten - only that way shall new always be found. **;
15;** CÃ©line probably rides along with us to the end of the night, making offhand remarks. **;
0;** Has anybody seen the keys that open the window to reach the stars? **;

0;** That cadence that beating in you is nothing but a feverish dream, a selfish attack against the One State. **;
20;** ...and as lovers they meet: different but equal in ways they couldn't tell... **;
0;** BEHOLD! Little more than beasts in humanly flesh will come! **;
0;** Move it! Only of bar stools, ephebes and nonsense may the future be made of! **;
25;** Not without surprise we stand and stand as time goes by... **;
0;** We once dreamed for elsewhere -- a gentler place -- and might regret if there we get... **;
0;** Ticking for not much longer and then... ...will we see your face again? **;
0;** At an unbreakable impasse with time Kochan stood -- monsters crept and creep still...  **;
0;** ...and forever after the monsters creeping would... **;
0;** AWAKE! OH EYES THAT SEE... But what will we find looking in these dreams? **;
0;** No longer shall we cross our eyes to see! Reality at last! Rejoice! **;
0;** Ahead: The giants of Don Quixote - a cautionary tale on dreams not begotten **;
0;** The king dreams he is king, and he lives in the deceit of a king... **;
0;** What good is a king without kingdom? What good a man lost of objectives? **;
0;** Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow... And then days evertold -- but nothing lest we act! **;
10;** Blue: faces behind shards of glass lost in the thick mist... Where are you? **;
0;** What do those forged smiles mean to the free men? **;
0;** The walk from here and onwards might deceivingly look cheerful. **;
0;** Oh Camillo Golgi... Why did you turn by brain into a Rosetta stone with the blue-tinted saddest tales? **;
0;** Down, down and sliding -- If sad, don't forget smiling... **;
0;** If I were you, I'd look up some 70's Canterbury bands to go with the Bucholics of this land... **;
0;** But as finding keys and levers that open mouths and brains is more important, I'd diversify as well. **;
0;** Nobody would have expected less from such a formidable team... **;
0;** Memories untold of Critilus would agree if they had been... **;
0;** And so rejoice! We may clear the path for other pointless ways to cross! **;
10;** Up or down -- does it matter? It all ends up being the same... **;
0;** Do beware of the beep-boop-boop-bah that might come to mess with you. **;
0;** Lasciate ogne speranza, o voi ch'intrate. **;
0;** The tide shall turn as we see a little man crashing through a window... **;
0;** In the endless halls of time rests the shade of Ahuramazda, erased by a crescent moon... **;
0;** Shall we equally erase the horizon onto which the burning hot sun sets? **;
0;** Ponder at times and remember how the journey began looking at a screen... **;
0;** Too meta it is for me to say if it was yours or instead this map's TV... **;
0;** Again we meet! Another battle! **;
0;** Fight this time not with bullets but just transparent fists! **;
0;** MOVE IT! The rumble is nigh! **;
0;** Tough luck, lads! Come back when you learn to read computer minds! **;
20;** Forget anything Keats said about urns! In the end we will all face the Jabberwock! **;
0;** Prepare the vorpal swords! What is ahead? A jub-jub bird? No! Just the shadow of beyond. **;
25;** Bardiblub Blidablibloop! The magician turned to goop! **;
0;** Look! Lucy is up there in the sky -- She has dynamite! **;
0;** Oh! And all those efforts so vain, wasted, just to reach further and then be slain!  **;
0;** Behold! It is time for the brundabogbog! **;
0;** Poor King Cool! Dreams and dreams of hamboighas he can't eat! **;
0;** FEED HIM! **;
25;** And so it awakes, hamboighed! Will only a piece of stardust, a clump of meat save us? **;
20;** ...and so the brave Ulysses rests his eyes on the stars... **;
0;** ...after battle held with passing hours for no one to understand... **;
0;** ...these words that lie forever, never turned to strokes by hand... **;
0;** ...and so the brave Ulysses rests: long forgotten in the past... **;
0;** Oh! What could you not have done with some more time? **;
0;** Sadly, we shall never know -- for time is the only resource truly long gone! **;
20;** Will we ever meet those who slept before us? **;
0;** I really don't know -- My name is Billy and I'm just the janitor... **;
0;** Who are these 'moguls from the top' these Cressida fellows so insistently chant about? **;
