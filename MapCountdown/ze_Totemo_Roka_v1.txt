0;** We have finally reached the Karuga archipelago... **;
0;** Totemo Roka lies ahead -- and beyond, the sacred city of Totghul Ka! **;
0;** Swim to the shore! We must reach the top! **;
0;** Something moved upon touching the gem... **;
0;** A relay of sorts seems to be moving in the back -- wait for something to happen! **;
0;** The way is clear! We must reach the top of Totemo Roka! **;
0;** We gotta hold our ground over here! **;
0;** This platform seems like some sort of lift -- do not let anything through!**;
0;** Some sort of contraption is rising! Do not let them reach us! **;
0;** The temple seems to rely on elevators upon elevators... **;
0;** Keep it up! We cannot afford to have them break through! **;
0;** We reached the first sacred seal! The path should clear soon! **;
0;** The temple may become far more ruthless from this point on... **;
0;** A SEAL WAS TAINTED BY THE INFECTED! THE GODS ARE ANGERED! **;
0;** YOU ARE DONE! **;
0;** HURRY BACK! The volcano is about to explode! **;
0;** We must get to the top! **;
0;** We are very close! Keep it up for the last bit! **;
0;** It shouldn't be hard to reach the summit! **;
0;** We are almost on the summit! The sacred city of Tot-ghul Ka awaits in the horizon! **;
0;** One more push! HOLD IT! **;
0;** This is the second seal! A way should appear for us to reach Tot-ghul Ka will open shortly! **;
0;** The legend was true! A bridge slashes through the waters of an everblue sea! JUMP! **;
0;** The gem only produced a faint sound, as if the effect was to be felt far away... **;
0;** We need to find a way into the walled temple! Move it! **;
0;** This is the third seal! The gates will open soon! **;
0;** First the entrance will fold, then the inner plaza will show itself to us! **;
0;** MOVE IT! THEY ARE EVERYWHERE! **;
0;** Hold your ground! The inner court is behind these doors, waiting for us! **;
0;** C'mon get inside! We have to unlock the energy of the last gems before the volcano blows up! **;
0;** YES! The final seal is right there! **;
0;** RESIST! WE ARE ABOUT TO GO! **;
0;** A secret passageway is opening! **;
0;** This is our chance to break free from the Totema Curse! **;
0;** Touch the gem at the helm -- there can't be much time left! **;
0;** We cracked the last seal! Our escape pod should be here soon! **;
