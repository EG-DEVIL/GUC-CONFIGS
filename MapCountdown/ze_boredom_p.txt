20;** Starting over in a twisted world - I'm quite sure this could be a song... **;
0;** The rhyme is bothersome for what I know but I'll tell you: you need to hold **;

0;** Upon leaving the wasteland by the buildingvator you might find dictators... **;
0;** The buildingvator will be leaving like a broken winter rose in a few seconds. **;
0;** Sitting in front of an angry chicken makes the road move **;
0;** COCKADODADOOO! **;
0;** From light to light there's a wooden door that might slip in time: wait. **;
25;** Saturn devouring his children is often criticised but... what would you do? **;
0;** As him -the Divine- often put eloquently the greatest form of love is cannibalism. **;
0;** The crisp bones and tender nerves. The beating hums of an everloving heart. **;
0;** Oedipus awaits in the empty halls of his voracious dreams. **;
0;** Charcoal seas of endless rain... Washed faces. Lights. Fog. Wind. **;
0;** The universe is collapsing because you were too slow to get to the party van... **;
25;** In the canyons of your mind I will wander through your brain... **;
0;** Seeing the shoreline of your thoughts always sparkling far away... **;
0;** And yet no boat to ever carry us to eachother's unknown end. **;
0;** GET GOING! I don't know what's going on but there's a boat! **;
10;** Endless ports of nevertime and endless instants of nowhere... **;
0;** And endless thoughts of nothing real - shades of memories long gone... **;
25;** In the graveyard where days lie hours seem distant and far away... **;
0;** When the eyes are closed and bound to deep sleep... who will wake them up to see? **;
0;** Journeys across the stars and amidst purple shades of voices turnt to dust... **;
0;** Who will see the dawn? **;
20;** There are seven eyes. Seven eyes. Seven eyes. **;
0;** The eyes are shattered like glass. The glass sings like the rain. The rain is old and knows no more. **;
0;** Where did all the people go? Only pale blue shadows I seem to know... **;
20;** HOLD! THE BRIDGE ENDS RIGHT HERE BUT THAT'S NO BIGGIE! **;

20;** Alright this is the end! The map did have a boss after all? **;
0;** I've stopped yelling because that's dandy I guess... Don't think there'd be more levels tho. **;
0;** Perhaps... nah... I doubt there'd be cliche appearances later on: that'd be silly... **;
0;** I wonder if zombies will get some items eventually too - that'd make it rather different. **;
0;** But I shouldn't really keep up any expectations nowadays - I'll end up disappointed probably. **;

0;** I am the map but... do I understand them? **;
0;** Does the mapper understand them even? And what about the mapper of the mapper? **;
0;** I will never know... Might there be more? What else? Crossing planes of different worlds? **;
0;** I wonder where I -the map- will ever go after this round: will I be the same? **;
0;** I don't know... I don't know... Up you go! **;
