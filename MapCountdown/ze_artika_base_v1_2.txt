0;** Chapter I: Ascension **;
0;** We've reached the southwest dock... **;
0;** We must find our way into the facility. **;
0;** This path should lead us to one of the several supply warehouses... **;
0;** RESIST! We need to access the main complex by unlocking this door! **;
0;** We're almost there! Don't let anything through! **;
0;** FALL BACK! It's about to open! **;
0;** We're nearing the neuralgic center of the complex... **;
0;** Hold until we are able to open this door! **;
0;** This button should unlock the doors and let us through... **;
0;** Resist while we wait for the doors to open! **;
0;** We'll need to reach one of the gas deposits to blow it up and delay their plans... **;
0;** Look at that! There is enough weaponry to start a massive offensive... **;
0;** According to our information we should be nearing a maintenance zone... **;
0;** The maintenance elevator should be enough to access the upper levels. **;
0;** GET GOING! We need to advance! **;
0;** The elevator is coming! RESIST! **;
0;** Call the elevator! We'll need to resist right here while it's coming... **;
0;** GET ON! THE ELEVATOR IS ABOUT TO LEAVE! **;
0;** Resist! This door shall take us to one of the middle areas! **;
0;** Keep it up! It's about to open! **;
0;** HOLD THEM RIGHT HERE! We need to unlock this door! **;
0;** GET CLOSE! We're about to breach in! **;
0;** We need to find a way to make those tanks blow up! **;
0;** Perhaps we can fiddle with the preasure using the control pannels? **;
0;** We did it! The pressure is increasing at exponential rates! **;
0;** Hold until we open the doors! We need a way out! **;
0;** Our information indicates there should be a small cargo elevator close to our position... **;
0;** This is our way out! Defend the elevator until it leaves! **;
0;** CHAPTER 1 COMPLETED - UNLOCKING CHAPTER 2 **;
0;** Chapter II: A touch of heaven **;
0;** The sabotage mission has been fulfilled. **;
0;** We need to escape from the facility... **;
0;** Resist! These security doors are sturdy - they'll take a bit to unlock! **;
0;** Keep it up! We're almost there. **;
0;** Our reports indicate some sort of archeologic research takes place here... **;
0;** Hold! We need to unlock the metal gates and then we'll access the caves. **;
0;** Almost there! Keep it up! **;
0;** Some kind of electromagnetic radiation is emitted by those cristals... **;
0;** They might be using those ruins and what they contain to develop some kind of new weapon. **;
0;** DEFEND! We need to find a way out - we are trapped! **;
0;** Some of these plates might open... Keep holding! **;
0;** This one seems to move... GO! **;
0;** Something in this hall is making the field detector go crazy! **;
0;** They seem to be using the ruins for something - they must be stopped. **;
0;** Hold the bridges! We need to open this door! **;
0;** RESIST! There's still a bit to go! **;
0;** ONE LAST EFFORT! HOLD IT!!! **;
0;** Keep going! We should soon reach the surface and see the iced fields of Antartika... **;
0;** Hold the vent! We will move out of this area soon... **;
0;** DAMN! The door! HOLD IT! **;
0;** What a harmonic view! It surely makes you feel as nothing but a clumsy dustmote in the universe... **;
0;** Cover all entrances! We're nearing our safety! **;
0;** RESIST! It won't take much longer to open this door! **;
0;** Keep it up! A few seconds left! **;
0;** We can see the complex below and the sea... **;
0;** We need to hold! We'll place charges on this bridge for it to blow up! **;
0;** The bomb is being planted! Don't let them past the middle of the bridge! *;
0;** CHAPTER 2 COMPLETED - UNLOCKING CHAPTER 3 **;
0;** Chapter III: The womb **;
0;** We must make our way towards the extraction point. **;
0;** Shall we decide our fate at last... **;
0;** We should be able to open these doors... Cover! **;
0;** Just a tiny bit more! Keep defending! **;
0;** FALL BACK! THIS IS READY TO GO! OPENING SOON! **;
0;** OAGH! IT STINKS IN HERE! HOLD YOUR BREATH AND RESIST! **;
0;** The stench is unbearable! We're opening the door as fast as we can - HOLD THEM! **;
0;** Get close! The door is about to open! **;
0;** Get moving! We might need to roam the abandoned basements to reach the main warehouse... **;
0;** This door should lead to one of the abandoned maintenance hallways! HOLD! **;
0;** Hold them off! Keep them up the stairs! **;
0;** DEFEND FOR THE LAST BIT! IT'S ABOUT TO OPEN! **;
0;** This area seems familiar... **;
0;** We're close to the weaponry warehouse we saw during the ascension! **;
0;** Wait for the team to regroup and hold - we will move on then! **;
0;** This door seems to be further locked than the previous ones... **;
0;** RESIST! It might take a while! Cover all entrances! **;
0;** KEEP IT UP! We're making progress! **;
0;** NEVER GIVE UP! TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS! **;
0;** GO! GO! GO! The door is open! **;
0;** We're nearing to the extraction point! One last effort! HOLD! **;
0;** KEEP RESISTING! IT'S ABOUT TO OPEN! **;
0;** This is the end of the line! RESIST! **;
0;** Our rescue chopper is approaching! We'll need to survive until it comes! **;
0;** Nuke inbound - Follow the rescue helicopter for it will take you to safety! **;
0;** C'MON IN! We need to go before we become roasted chicken! **;
0;** LOSING ALTITUDE! KEEP THEM OUT! **;
