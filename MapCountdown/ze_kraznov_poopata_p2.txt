0;** Welcome to the mystical island of Kraznov Poopata **;
0;** Its existence is far away from time or matter - it exists out of pure belief **;
0;** The horror of absolute reason of no doubt might be released soon! Beware! **;
0;** TIP: This previous bullcrap means we have to hold the spawn area... **;
0;** A wall of stubbornness will open soon and will the journey begin... **;
0;** Descend back to purity to play the games that had once freed you **;
0;** and meet again the wippity part of yourselves... **;
0;** TIP: I think that means you have to play some puzzle or game now... **;
0;** There is an orange cube thing and a sorta basket thing... Might it be basketball? **;
0;** YOU'RE GETTING POOPFARTED FOR BEING 2LOW WACKOS **;
0;** ERRBODY GETTIN' DEDED - GO H8 THE MAP MOAR! **;
0;** Now reborn into pure innocence freedom comes at last... **;
10;** You might be exhausted from all that physical exercise - take the elevator! **;
0;** Staying in the middle is the best way to ensure you will go up... **;
25;** May you rest again or try hard for a futile bounty... **;
0;** TIP: Holding without going into the seizure-inducing bridge is good - if you don't want a present. **;
0;** And all this tiresome effort for a simple cartoony cock? Oh dear... **;
0;** Go ahead! Your path is full of endless posibilities! **;
0;** Down you go - perhaps it is sadness knocking? **;
0;** It's a simple elevator... **;
0;** Thanks for the tip!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!1!1!one **;
0;** Among the stars a cavern of endless night in blue and black awaits... **;
15;** The cavern is godawful and ugly - as it is a metaphor for your face **;
0;** TIP: That shit is retarded. Hold a bit and the purple wall will open. **;
0;** Another uppity down thingo wacko thong... The mapper obviously doesn't know what to do! **;
0;** At times the tree of life branches and the green lively leaves have to say goodbye... **;
0;** TIP: I think that's actually a bit straightforward... UR ALL MORANS!!! **;
0;** That was not nice. At all. **;
0;** TIP: Sigh... OK - Split up and press both buttons (red blocks) at the same time (YAY INNOVATIVE!!!) **;
0;** Go ahead! Your path is full of endless possibilities! **;
0;** And now for once meet the universally known bridges of stupidity! **;
0;** The only fierce bridges in the mystical world of belief that enforce backpedalling! **;
0;** Remember! Those bridges are named as such because only stupids backpedal! **;
0;** TIP: Walking forward is sketchy. You will have to walk backwards for ease. **;
0;** Use your mouse and jump to hold and get to the end. **;
0;** This door right here opens faster if you give it some sweet loving - I swear! **;
0;** TIP: The map would never lie. EVER. Go hug the door. **;
0;** Most of the time you are waiting for things that aren't worth it **;
0;** Oh! Statistics time! **;
0;** Map: 2 - People that make their mom ashamed with their stupidity: 0 **;
20;** OK! Get going a bit - You'll need to hold that shapeless attempt of a thing right there! **;
0;** You're kinda starting to get my feelings hurt and it's not nice... **;
0;** They're obviously bridged nipples! Don't you see? **;
0;** Why are you even bothering with this map? It's just helpless... **;
0;** There's good news and bad news! **;
0;** The good news is that the end of the map is close - thank the Holy Molly goo! **;
0;** The bad ones... well... There's this absurd puzzle thing here I don't even understand. **;
10;** Really wild - You solved it! **;
0;** Although it is a piss easy puzzle if we are completely fair... Matching colors? Boo! **;
0;** GET OUT! This map is stinking more and more as time goes by! **;
15;** Alright! It's not that we should tryhard here but holding a bit would be cool... **;
0;** When the end is near pancakes become tastier **;
0;** Run for the end! This is like the last stand... GO FULL TRYHARD! **;
0;** I was the other day like wondering how would zombie pancakes taste... **;
0;** They'd kinda be gooey and mushy but also crunchy and putrid - so neat **;
0;** I wish I could eat zombie pancakes for once... **;
0;** Please kill. Faster kill. Go kill. Kill kill. **;
0;** The pain of being such a horrible map is unbearable... **;
0;** I hope the creator - THE CREATOR! - steps on a lego and dies of internal bleeding **;
0;** Oh look! Pancakes!!! **;
0;** Map: 27 - People that make their mom ashamed with their stupidity: 0 **;
0;** Cooperation for once brought success to the situation **;
0;** Who would have said... Heh? **;
0;** Most of the time patience is virtue - the rest of it it's just boring **;
0;** Yeah right... Let's hold right here again because we need to make this awful map even longer. **;
0;** MAD FUCKING MAPPING SKILLS. I. TELL. YOU. **;
0;** A leap of faith is usually needed to get your endeavours to a good end **;
0;** Great! Now we all might die if the map is just a troll map. REAL FUCKING FUN. **;
0;** Cool! You solved the puzzle designed for toddlers! **;
0;** It's like whoever made this piece of shit wants people to rtv  the fuck out... **;
0;** You should probably feel proud **;
0;** It might be a good idea to get going and try to survive the awkwardness of the map and all... **;
0;** This is just pointless. Another fucking senseless hold? Fuck off. **;
0;** I will break the wall pretty fast because it just doesn't make any fucking sense... **;
0;** HOCUS POCUS ABRA CADABRA YOUR MOM IS A WOOPA CUNTA PALABRA! **;
0;** Again it comes a time to freely jump and just believe you can fly... **;
0;** But beware! Perhaps only accurate faith will let you make it! **;
0;** Map: 1 - People that make their mom ashamed with their stupidity: 0 **;
